# UART Servo Data Table
Due to space limitations, the following tables use some [abbreviations](#Abbreviation-List).

### Details
#### Status
* **bit 0** : The bit will be set to 1 during command execution, and be set to 0 after the command is completed.
* **bit 1** : The bit will be set to 1 when a command execution error is occured, and be set to 0 after the next correct execution.
* **bit 2** : The bit will be set to 1 when a high voltage error is occured, and be set to 0 after the voltage is normal.
* **bit 3** : The bit will be set to 1 when a low voltage error is occured, and be set to 0 after the voltage is normal.
* **bit 4** : The bit will be set to 1 when an overcurrent error is occured, and be set to 0 after the current is normal.
* **bit 5** : The bit will be set to 1 when power ouput of the servo is higher than the setting value, and be set to 0 as the power ouput is within the allowable range.
* **bit 6** : The bit will be set to 1 when temperature of the servo is higher than the setting value, and be set to 0 as the temperature is within the allowable range.
* **bit 7** : The bit will be set to 1 when a stall error is occured, and be set to 0 after the stall is released.

### Details
#### Responsive
In the spin or rotate mode, whether the servo has responded after completing the command.</br>If the value is set to non-zero(true), the old command cannot be interrupted by the new command. The waiting commands will be added to a limited queue, if the queue is full, the newest one is discarded.</br>If the value is set to zero(false), the past command can be interrupted by the new command and the response packet will not be sent back.</br>The default value is zero (false).
